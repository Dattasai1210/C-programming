1.Pointer:

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a=10;
    int *p;
    p=&a;
    printf("Address of p is %d\n",p);
    printf("Value of p is %d",*p);
    return 0;
}

2.Pointer arithematic:

    #include<stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
    int n=50;
    int *p;
    p=&n;
    printf("Address of p variable is %u \n",p);
    p=p+1;
    printf("After increment: Address of p variable is %u\n",p);
    p=p-1;
    printf("After decrement: Address of p variable is %u\n",p);
    p=p+3;
    printf("After addition: Address of p variable is %u\n",p);
    p=p-3;
    printf("After subtraction: Address of p variable is %u\n",p);
    return 0;
    }
